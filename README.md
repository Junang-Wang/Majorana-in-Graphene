# Majorana-in-Graphene
This project is may be my last one during my academic career and also the first one I use github to track the whole progrom. 
Our main goal of this project is to proposing a graphene-superconductor hybrid device supported Majorana Fermions. I know I should explain all these weird physics vocabulary, but I would not do it for now on (in the future maybe I will). For the people who are not familiar with the concept on topology in condensed matter physics, I highly recommend [the online course on topology in condensed matter](https://topocondmat.org/index.html).
## To Do
- [ ] Talk about our motivation.
- [ ] Explain our idea briefly and why it work.
